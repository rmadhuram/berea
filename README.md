Bible Jeopardy

> The people of **Berea** were more open-minded than the people of Thessalonica. They were very willing to receive God's message, and every day they **carefully examined the Scriptures** to see if what Paul said was true. - Acts 17:11 

This is an adaptation of the famous TV show Jeopardy!, to be played in a small group setting.

I first coded this in Java, to be used in a small Bible group in San Diego between 2001-2005. 
The new version is completely rebuilt in JavaScript / node.js.
