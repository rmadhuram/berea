Bible Jeopardy

> The people of **Berea** were more open-minded than the people of Thessalonica. They were very willing to receive God's message, and every day they **carefully examined the Scriptures** to see if what Paul said was true. - Acts 17:11 

This is an adaptation of the famous TV show Jeopardy!, to be played in a small group setting.

I first coded this in Java, to be used in a small Bible group in San Diego between 2001-2005. 
The new version is completely rebuilt in JavaScript / node.js.

## Installation

You need to have node.js / npm / bower installed on your computer. 

#### 1. Install npm packages (server side dependencies)
`npm install`

#### 2. Install bower packages (client side dependencies)
`bower install`

#### 3. Install gulp (if you don't have already)

https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start

#### 4. Start server

`gulp server`

## Running a Quiz Program
Once the server is started, you are set to run a quiz show. Everything is browser based. 
There are two screens:
- A **show screen** visible to the audience, and most likely projected on to a big screen.
- A **controller screen** visible only to the quiz master.

The show screen should be a browser window in full screen mode 
(could be running on the same computer as the server), and the controller 
screen should be a browser, preferably on a handheld device. Both devices should be on the
**same** network.

The show screen is initialized using this URL

`http://localhost:8080/game/init`

The controller screen is initialized using this URL

`http://localhost:8080/ctrl/init`

Replace localhost with the IP of the server on the controller screen.
